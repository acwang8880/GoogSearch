This directory contains the files to set up and run a worker to service the photo
stitcher queue.

To get started:

1. Copy templates/.* and templates/* into the worker
directory and fill in your authentication information. You should probably
"chmod 600" these files.

  * .google_cloud_auth -- This is needed by the worker to talk to the task queue
    service. You can generate this by installing and running the
    gtaskqueue_puller application. The easiest way is to start a worker, run the
    setup.sh script (below) and the run gtaskqueue_puller to prompt
    authentication.

You also need to modify service_queue.sh with the appid of the AppEngine that
you will be servicing. Also modify other parameters as appropriate. The most
basic ones are :
 - It tries to run 8 workers at a time. (num_tasks).
 - Lease time is 10 mins/task. (lease_secs).
 - There are also advanced ones, run gtaskqueue_puller --help for details.

4. Set up the workers.

  $ ./setup.sh
  <lots of spew -- hopefully everything works!>

5. Start the stitcher up

  $ ./service_queue.sh

6. Stop the stitcher:
  killall -9 gtaskqueue_puller
